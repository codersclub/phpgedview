/**
 * Represents a collection of GEDCOM data.  That collection
 * may come from a variety of sources such as a file, a 
 * database, or a remote source such as a web service.
 * 
 * A Gedcom includes a collection of Records.  Records represent
 * all level 0 GEDCOM items.
 * 
 * The methods addRecord, getRecordById and updateRecord define a
 * simple API for working with GEDCOM records. 
 * 
 * The Nextids are used for keeping track of the next GEDCOM
 * XREF id for different types of records.
 * 
 * The other methods are for convenience in working with databases
 * or files.
